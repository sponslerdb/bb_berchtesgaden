  abstract  = "Abstract In terms of origin, grasslands in Central Europe can be
               classified into (i) natural grasslands, predetermined by
               environmental conditions and wild herbivores; (ii) seminatural
               grasslands, associated with long-term human activity from the
               beginning of agriculture during the Mesolithic?Neolithic
               transition; and (iii) improved (intensive) grasslands, a product
               of modern agriculture based on sown and highly productive forage
               grasses and legumes. This review discusses the origin, history
               and development of grasslands in Central Europe from the
               Holocene (9500 BC) to recent times, using archaeobotanical
               (pollen and macroremains), archaeozoological (molluscs, dung
               beetles, animal bones) and archaeological evidence, together
               with written and iconographic resources and recent analogies. An
               indicator of grasslands is the ratio of non-arboreal/arboreal
               pollen and the presence of pollen of species such as Plantago
               lanceolata and Urtica dioica in sediments. Pastures can be
               indicated by Juniperus communis pollen and charcoal present in
               sediments and the soil profile. Insect-pollinated species can be
               studied using cesspit sediments and pollen (from honey) in
               vessels in graves. In Central Europe, natural steppe, alluvial
               grasslands and alpine grasslands occurred before the start of
               agriculture in the early Neolithic (5500 BC); their area was
               small, and grassland patches were fragmentary in the forested
               landscape. Substantial enlargement of grasslands cannot be
               expected to have occurred before the late Bronze Age. The first
               scythes come from the 7th?6th century BC; therefore, hay meadows
               probably did not develop before this time. There is evidence of
               hay meadows in Central Europe during the Middle Ages, documented
               by macroremains of Arrhenatherum elatius in sediments, written
               records and long scythes in archaeological assemblages. Based on
               macroremains analyses, we conclude that there was generally high
               diversity of seminatural grasslands in the cultural landscape in
               the Middle Ages, and individual grassland communities were
               generally species rich. From the beginning of the agriculture
               until the 18th century, pastures and pasture forests were
               dominant sources of forage. Large-scale enlargement of hay
               meadows and decline of pastures in many regions occurred from
               the 18th century. Hay making is associated with enlargement of
               arable fields and the use of cattle as draught animals for
               ploughing and soil preparation. The spread of A. elatius in
               Central Europe was enabled by the decline of grazing management
               and an increased proportion of hay meadows in the 18th and 19th
               centuries. In some mountain areas, there are no records of
               large-scale deforestation and enlargement of grasslands until
               the 14th century, and the peak of the agriculturally used area
               was recorded for the period from the 18th to the first half of
               the 20th century. Grasslands were converted into arable land
               during periods of war; conversely, grasslands replaced arable
               land after the collapse of agriculture in many regions of former
               communist countries following political regime change in the
               1990s. The dynamics of the grassland area reflect the
               development of human society and the political situation,
               because grasslands are an integral part of the cultural
               landscape in Central Europe.",

  abstract = "Vespine wasps (Vespula sp.) are endowed with a pronounced ability
              of endothermic heat production. To show how they balance
              energetics and thermoregulation under variable environmental
              conditions, we measured the body temperature and respiration of
              sucrose foragers (1.5 M, unlimited flow) under variable ambient
              temperature (Ta = 20--35 °C) and solar radiation (20--570 W m−2).
              Results revealed a graduated balancing of metabolic efforts with
              thermoregulatory needs. The thoracic temperature in the shade
              depended on ambient temperature, increasing from ~37 to 39 °C.
              However, wasps used solar heat gain to regulate their thorax
              temperature at a rather high level at low Ta (mean Tthorax ~ 39
              °C). Only at high Ta they used solar heat to reduce their
              metabolic rate remarkably. A high body temperature accelerated
              the suction speed and shortened foraging time. As the costs of
              foraging strongly depended on duration, the efficiency could be
              significantly increased with a high body temperature. Heat gain
              from solar radiation enabled the wasps to enhance foraging
              efficiency at high ambient temperature (Ta = 30 °C) by up to 63
              \%. The well-balanced change of economic strategies in response
              to environmental conditions minimized costs of foraging and
              optimized energetic efficiency.",

  author   = "Oyen, K Jeannet and Giri, Susma and Dillon, Michael E",
  abstract = "Organism critical thermal limits are often tightly linked to
              current geographic distribution and can therefore help predict
              future range shifts driven by changing environmental
              temperatures. Thermal tolerance of diverse organisms often varies
              predictably with latitude, with upper thermal limits changing
              little and lower thermal limits decreasing with latitude. Despite
              similarly steep gradients in environmental temperatures across
              altitude, few studies have investigated altitudinal variation in
              critical thermal limits. We estimated critical thermal minimum
              (CTmin), critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and recovery
              temperature (Trec) by tracking righting response of three bumble
              bee species during thermal ramps: Bombus huntii collected from
              2180m asl, and Bombus bifarius and Bombus sylvicola collected
              from 3290m asl in Wyoming, USA. Overall, larger bees could
              tolerate more extreme temperatures, likely due to a thermal
              inertia driven lag between core body temperatures and air
              temperatures. Despite their smaller size, high altitude bumble
              bees tolerated colder air temperatures: they had ~1°C lower CTmin
              and recovered from cold exposure at ~3-4°C lower air
              temperatures. Conversely, low altitude bees tolerated ~5°C hotter
              air temperatures. These altitudinal differences in thermal
              tolerance parallel differences in average daily minimum (1.2°C)

  abstract  = "What does ``alpine'' mean? One common explanation is that the
               term is of Latin origin and means ``white'' or ``snow-covered''
               (from ``albus'' = white, with reference to the North Italian
               peaks of the Alps as seen by the Romans; L{\"o}ve 1970).
               However, today linguists consider this as purely coincidental
               and the term is most likely of pre-Roman origin, with ``alp'' or
               ``alb'' standing for ``mountain'' in general. Even the Basques
               use ``alpo'' for mountain flanks in their non-Indo-Germanic,
               ancient language. Traditional terms as Alpe/Alpes (Romanic
               languages), Alp (Swiss and other Allemannic regions) or Alm
               (Austrian or Bavarian) used by farmers in the Alps refer to
               man-made pastures for summer grazing at or below the upper
               treeline. In today's common language ``alpine'' is often applied
               to whole mountain regions including valleys and townships or is
               used as a general substitute for mountains. These uses of the
               word ``alpine'' do not match the meaning of ``alpine zone'' in
               the current context.",

              fulfil an important ecological and economical function as
              pollinators of wild and agricultural flowering plants and crops.
              The Himalayan mountain range provides ample suitable habitats for
              bumble bees. Systematic study of Himalayan bumble bees began a
              few decades ago and the main focus has centred on the western
              region, while the eastern part of the mountain range has received
              little attention and only a few species have been verified.
              During a three-year survey, more than 700 bumble bee specimens of

  abstract  = "Abstract The elevational gradient of species richness is often
               claimed to mirror the latitudinal gradient and has traditionally
               been explained by assuming a decrease in productivity with
               elevation and more recently by Rapoport's rule. The influence of
               area on the pattern has rarely been considered. Analyses of all
               South American tropical land birds (more than one?fourth of the
               extant bird species on Earth) are used to examine four species
               richness/elevation models: null model, Rapoport's rule, and
               monotonic or hump?shaped productivity/species richness
               relationships. To quantify the area effect, species?area curves
               were created for seven elevational zones. Not accounting for
               area, species richness declined monotonically with elevation,
               but area accounted for 67\%?91\% of the variation in species
               richness per zone. When area was factored out, a hump?shaped
               pattern emerged, with more species in the 500?1,000?m (P<.005)
               and 1,000?1,500?m zones (P<.10) than in the 0?500?m zone.
               Rapoport's rule and the monotonic productivity/species richness
               relationship were thus not supported. Instead, elevational
               turnover rates and numbers of shared species between zones
               suggested that the hump?shaped pattern re flects geometric
               constraints (as predicted by the null model) imposed by the
               narrow span of the gradient, and it is suggested that

               major challenge in ecology. A critical step in that challenge is
               to understand how changing environmental conditions influence
               processes across levels of ecological organization. While direct
               scaling from individual to ecosystem dynamics can lead to robust
               and mechanistic predictions, new approaches are needed to
               appropriately translate questions through the community level.
               Species invasion, loss, and turnover all necessitate this
               scaling through community processes, but predicting how such
               changes may influence ecosystem function is notoriously
               difficult. We suggest that community-level dynamics can be
               incorporated into scaling predictions using a trait-based
               response?effect framework that differentiates the community
               response to environmental change (predicted by response traits)
               and the effect of that change on ecosystem processes (predicted
               by effect traits). We develop a response-and-effect functional
               framework, concentrating on how the relationships among species'
               response, effect, and abundance can lead to general predictions
               concerning the magnitude and direction of the influence of
               environmental change on function. We then detail several key
               research directions needed to better scale the effects of
               environmental change through the community level. These include
               (1) effect and response trait characterization, (2) linkages
               between response-and-effect traits, (3) the importance of
               species interactions on trait expression, and (4) incorporation

               approach, including over 175,000 presence records of benthic
               genera for the North Sea, to identify environmental (bed shear
               stress, sediment grain size, temperature) and anthropogenic
               parameters (trawling effort) driving benthic community
               composition over a 21-year period. We applied a Gradient Forest
               analysis, based on Random Forests, to estimate the locations and
               importance of thresholds where small cumulative increases in the
               predictors drive a much greater change in genus composition than
               would be expected from linear effects. Shear stress was the most
               important predictor of benthic community composition. Trawling

               primary determinants of benthic communities. Our results suggest
               that a genus composition threshold for both infauna and
               epifaunal benthic communities is crossed when the seafloor is
               trawled as little as once every 4 years. Higher trawling levels
               corresponded with gradual compositional change without obvious
               thresholds, which would be consistent with chronic fishing in
               the North Sea over the last two centuries having caused
               persistent, long-term changes in ecosystem structure and
               functioning. This was corroborated by the large-scale spatial

              predicted due to climate change. Yet, it is unclear how changing
              precipitation regimes may affect nitrogen (N) cycling, especially
              in areas with extremely high aridity. Here we investigate soil N
              isotopic values ($\delta$(15)N) along a 3,200 km aridity gradient
              and reveal a hump-shaped relationship between soil $\delta$(15)N
              and aridity index (AI) with a threshold at AI=0.32. Variations of
              foliar $\delta$(15)N, the abundance of nitrification and
              denitrification genes, and metabolic quotient along the gradient
              provide further evidence for the existence of this threshold.
              Data support the hypothesis that the increase of gaseous N loss
              is higher than the increase of net plant N accumulation with
              increasing AI below AI=0.32, while the opposite is favoured above
              this threshold. Our results highlight the importance of N-cycling
              microbes in extremely dry areas and suggest different controlling
              factors of N-cycling on either side of the threshold.",

  abstract = "Novel physical and chemical conditions of many modern ecosystems
              increasingly diverge from the environments known to have existed
              at any time in the history of Earth. The loss of natural land to
              urbanization is one of the most prevalent drivers of novel
              environments in freshwaters. However, current understanding of
              aquatic community response to urbanization is based heavily upon
              aggregate indicators of community structure and linear or
              wedge-shaped community response models that challenge ecological
              community theory. We applied a new analytical method, threshold
              indicator taxa analysis (TITAN), to a stream biomonitoring data
              set from Maryland to explicitly evaluate linear community
              response models to urbanization that implicitly assume individual
              taxa decline or increase at incrementally different levels of
              urbanization. We used TITAN (1) to identify the location and
              magnitude of greatest change in the frequency and abundance of
              individual taxa and (2) to assess synchrony in the location of
              change points as evidence for stream community thresholds in
              response to percent impervious cover in catchments. We documented
              clear and synchronous threshold declines of 110 of 238
              macroinvertebrate taxa in response to low levels of impervious
              cover. Approximately 80\% of the declining taxa did so between
              0.5\% and 2\% impervious cover, whereas the last 20\% declined
              sporadically from 2\% to 25\% impervious cover. Synchrony of
              individual responses resulted in distinct community-level
              thresholds ranging from < or = 0.68\% (mountains), 1.28\%
              (piedmont), and 0.96\% (coastal plain) impervious cover. Upper
              limits (95\% confidence intervals) of community thresholds were <
              2\% cover in all regions. Within distinct physiographic classes,
              higher-gradient, smaller catchments required less impervious
              cover than lower gradient, larger catchments to elicit community
              thresholds. Relatively few taxa showed positive responses to
              increasing impervious cover, and those that did gradually
              increased in frequency and abundance, approximating a linear
              cumulative distribution. The sharp, synchronous declines of
              numerous taxa established a consistent threshold response at
              exceptionally low levels of catchment urbanization, and
              uncertainty regarding the estimation of impervious cover from
              satellite data was mitigated by several corroborating lines of
              evidence. We suggest that threshold responses of communities to
              urban and other novel environmental gradients may be more
              prevalent than currently recognized.",

  abstract = "In a context of global changes, and amidst the perpetual
              modification of community structure undergone by most natural
              ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how
              species interactions vary through space and time. The integration
              of biogeography and network theory will yield important results
              and further our understanding of species interactions. It has,
              however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify
              variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general
              framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction
              networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use
              of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network
              dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components,
              so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of
              $\beta$-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up $\beta$-diversity
              of community composition to the $\beta$-diversity of interactions
              requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will
              help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework
              with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and
              highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda
              towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.",

               considered outside of a vertebrate context. Here, however, we
               show that nectar robbing by bumble-bees (Bombus terrestris)-an
               invertebrate behaviour of considerable ecological
               significance-has the potential to spread through a population at
               the accelerated rates typical of social transmission. Nectar
               robbing occurs when individuals either bite through the base of
               a flower to 'steal' nectar (primary robbing) or use robbing
               holes that others have made (secondary robbing). We found that
               experience of foraging from robbed flowers significantly
               promoted the development of primary robbing in previously
               legitimate foragers, thus implying that the acquisition of
               nectar robbing by one individual will facilitate its adoption in
               others. Our findings suggest that the positive feedback effects
               of social transmission may potentially play an ecologically
               important role in the relationship between plants and

               na{\"\i}ve animals to find food. As inexperienced bees are known
               to have strong innate colour biases we investigated whether
               bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies with stronger biases for
               the most rewarding flower colour (violet) foraged more
               successfully in their local flora. To test the adaptive
               significance of variation in innate colour bias, we compared the
               performance of colour-na{\"\i}ve bees, from nine bumblebee
               colonies raised from local wild-caught queens, in a laboratory
               colour bias paradigm using violet (bee UV-blue) and blue (bee
               blue) artificial flowers. The foraging performance of the same
               colonies was assessed under field conditions. Colonies with a
               stronger innate bias for violet over blue flowers in the
               laboratory harvested more nectar per unit time under field
               conditions. In fact, the colony with the strongest bias for
               violet (over blue) brought in 41\% more nectar than the colony
               with the least strong bias. As violet flowers in the local area
               produce more nectar than blue flowers (the next most rewarding
               flower colour), these data are consistent with the hypothesis

               communities of bumblebees in northern Spain along an altitudinal
               gradient. Local species abundance and altitudinal range occupied
               accounted for much of the variation in species distribution.
               Altitudinal range occupied by species was related to species
               distribution, but the most important variable accounting for
               species distribution was the local percentage abundance. Despite
               this, there was no evidence for age abundance. Despite this,
               there was no evidence for bimodality in the distributions of
               species incidence. A general trends for mean proboscis length in
               each locality to be greater in lowland localities exists, but
               this variable was not related to species distribution or
               abundance. Proboscis length spacings were studied among species

               Bombus terrestris",
  author    = "Ings, Thomas C and Raine, Nigel E and Chittka, Lars",
  abstract  = "Studies of innate colour preference and learning ability have
               focused on differences at the species level, rather than
               variation among populations of a single species. Initial
               strength and persistence of colour preferences are likely to
               affect colour choices of na{\"\i}ve flower visitors. We
               therefore study the influence of both the strength and
               persistence of innate colour preference (for blue) on an operant
               learning task (associating food reward with yellow flowers) in
               two populations of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We found
               that both strength and persistence of blue preference differed
               significantly between populations: B. terrestris dalmatinus had
               a weaker and less persistent blue preference than B. terrestris
               audax. These differences in preference also influenced learning
               performance. Considering only landing behaviours, one-trial
               learning occurred in the majority (73\%) of bees, and was
               achieved sooner in B. terrestris dalmatinus because of its
               weaker blue preference. However, compared to landing behaviours
               the relative frequency of approach flights to rewarding and
               unrewarding flower types changed more slowly with task
               experience in both populations. When considering both approaches
               and landings, the rate of learning, following the first rewarded
               learning trial, was faster in B. terrestris audax than B.
               terrestris dalmatinus. However, the net effects of population
               differences in blue preference and learning dynamics result in
               similar final levels of task performance. Our results provide
               new evidence of behavioural differences among isolated
               populations within a single species, and raise intriguing
               questions about the ecological significance and adaptive nature
               of colour preference.",

              bumblebees? A response to Goulson et al",
  author   = "Williams, Paul H",
  abstract = "Recent studies of British bumblebees have proposed a seemingly
              simple explanation for the decline in some species: that greater
              dietary specialization among the rarer species has put them at
              greater risk. However, comparisons of dietary specialization
              require: (1) that bees have access to the same dietary options
              among which to make their choices; (2) that the differing
              relative breadths of dietary choices made are not obscured by the
              differing sample sizes among bee species. Using one of the few
              suitable data sets, I find no evidence for a relationship
              between, on the one hand, rarity or declines in British
              bumblebees and, on the other, their dietary breadths, the
              strengths of their dietary preferences, or their proboscis
              lengths (which influence dietary choices). In contrast, there is
              support for a relationship between rarity or declines within
              Britain and the sizes of species' European ranges, particularly
              when these measures are adjusted to represent their ranges near
              sea level. Adjusted range sizes may reflect overall niche breadth
              and perhaps climatic and habitat specialization. This is not to
              say that climate change is the driving factor for declines or
              that changing food-plant availability is unimportant, but that
              climatic and habitat specialization may be a better indicator of
              risk of decline, which deserves further study.",

               generalized additive model (GAM) and the hierarchical model
               (HGLM). The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of
               nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and
               outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between
               different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical
               connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model
               different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability
               in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted
               using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also
               discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these
               models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data. All
