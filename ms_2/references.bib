  abstract  = "AbstractContemporary niche theory is a useful framework for
               understanding how organisms interact with each other and with
               their shared environment. Its graphical representation,
               popularized by Tilman's resource ratio hypothesis, facilitates
               analysis of the equilibrium structure of complex dynamical
               models, including species coexistence. This theory has been
               applied primarily to resource competition since its early
               beginnings. Here, we integrate mutualism into niche theory by
               expanding Tilman's graphical representation to the analysis of
               consumer-resource dynamics of plant-pollinator networks. We
               graphically explain the qualitative phenomena previously found
               by numerical simulations, including the effects on community
               dynamics of nestedness, adaptive foraging, and pollinator
               invasions. Our graphical approach promotes the unification of
               niche and network theories and deepens the synthesis of
               different types of interactions within a consumer-resource
               framework.",

               and pollinator ecotype formation",
  author    = "Newman, Ethan and Manning, John and Anderson, Bruce",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pollinator landscapes, as determined by
               pollinator morphology/behaviour, can vary inter- or
               intraspecifically, imposing divergent selective pressures and
               leading to geographically divergent floral ecotypes. Assemblages
               of plants pollinated by the same pollinator (pollinator guilds)
               should exhibit convergence of floral traits because they are
               exposed to similar selective pressures. Both convergence and the
               formation of pollination ecotypes should lead to matching of
               traits among plants and their pollinators. METHODS: We examined
               17 floral guild members pollinated in all or part of their range
               by Prosoeca longipennis, a long-proboscid fly with geographic
               variation in tongue length. Attractive floral traits such as
               colour, and nectar properties were recorded in populations
               across the range of each species. The length of floral
               reproductive parts, a mechanical fit trait, was recorded in each
               population to assess possible correlation with the mouthparts of
               the local pollinator. A multiple regression analysis was used to
               determine whether pollinators or abiotic factors provided the
               best explanation for variation in floral traits, and pollinator
               shifts were recorded in extralimital guild member populations.
               KEY RESULTS: Nine of the 17 species were visited by alternative
               pollinator species in other parts of their ranges, and these
               displayed differences in mechanical fit and attractive traits,
               suggesting putative pollination ecotypes. Plants pollinated by
               P. longipennis were similar in colour throughout the pollinator
               range. Tube length of floral guild members co-varied with the
               proboscis length of P. longipennis. CONCLUSIONS: Pollinator
               shifts have resulted in geographically divergent pollinator
               ecotypes across the ranges of several guild members. However,
               within sites, unrelated plants pollinated by P. longipennis are
               similar in the length of their floral parts, most probably as a
               result of convergent evolution in response to pollinator
               morphology. Both of these lines of evidence suggest that
               pollinators play an important role in selecting for certain
               floral traits.",

  author    = "Palmer, Todd M and Stanton, Maureen L and Young, Truman P",
  abstract  = "Mutualistic interactions are diverse and widespread and often
               involve multispecies guilds of mutualists competing for access
               to one or more partner species. Despite the ubiquity of these
               interactions, we know little about the dynamics of competition
               and coexistence within these guilds or how interactions between
               mutualists and their shared resource (the partner species) may
               influence these dynamics. In this article, we review the
               evidence for interspecific competition for partners within
               mutualist guilds in both plant-pollinator and ant-myrmecophyte
               systems. We then review evidence for the operation of different
               coexistence mechanisms within these guilds and discuss how the
               dynamics of competition and coexistence may be uniquely shaped
               by multispecies mutualist interactions. In particular, we note
               that adaptive and plastic responses by mutualists to variation
               in partner quality are likely to play an important role in
               determining these dynamics. We summarize by considering the
               ecological conditions that are likely to restrict or promote
               species coexistence within mutualist guilds. We suggest that
               these guilds may provide powerful model systems for exploring
               multiple mechanisms of species coexistence, and we discuss how
               these mechanisms may be modified by evolutionary adaptation.",

  title     = "Coexistence and competitive exclusion in mutualism",
  author    = "Johnson, Christopher A and Bronstein, Judith L",
  abstract  = "The competitive exclusion principle is fundamental to
               understanding coexistence. Well-established theories predict the
               conditions for coexistence in consumer-resource interactions.
               Given that species often compete for commodities offered by
               mutualists, competitive exclusion theory should also be critical
               to understanding how mutualisms function. We explicitly apply
               the competitive exclusion principle to mutualism and derive a
               rule analogous to Tilman's R* rule for exploitative competition.
               Coexistence is impossible when competitors compete solely for a
               shared partner-provided commodity because superior competitors
               deplete that commodity sufficiently to exclude inferior
               competitors. We then investigate how competition between two
               guild members for a partner-provided commodity and a resource
               external to the mutualism affects competitor coexistence. There
               are three key results. First, coexistence is possible via
               partitioning of a partner-provided commodity and another
               resource. Second, unlike in classic R* Theory, competitive
               outcomes are influenced both by species' abilities to obtain
               commodities and their mutualisms with the shared
               commodity-providing partner, which can indirectly alleviate
               competitors' commodity limitation. Third, the outcome of
               competition has important consequences for the
               commodity-providing partner, which depend on the type of
               mutualism and the competitive abilities of competing mutualists.
               This theory provides a novel framework for investigating how
               competitors for mutualistic commodities coexist in nature.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are becoming
              increasingly interested in networks as a framework to study
              plant-animal mutualisms within their ecological context. Although
              such focus on networks has brought about important insights into
              the structure of these interactions, relatively little is still
              known about the mechanisms behind these patterns. SCOPE: The aim
              in this paper is to offer an overview of the mechanisms
              influencing the structure of plant-animal mutualistic networks. A
              brief summary is presented of the salient network patterns, the
              potential mechanisms are discussed and the studies that have
              evaluated them are reviewed. This review shows that researchers
              of plant-animal mutualisms have made substantial progress in the
              understanding of the processes behind the patterns observed in
              mutualistic networks. At the same time, we are still far from a
              thorough, integrative mechanistic understanding. We close with
              specific suggestions for directions of future research, which
              include developing methods to evaluate the relative importance of
              mechanisms influencing network patterns and focusing research

              modification of community structure undergone by most natural
              ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how
              species interactions vary through space and time. The integration
              of biogeography and network theory will yield important results
              and further our understanding of species interactions. It has,
              however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify
              variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general
              framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction
              networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use
              of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network
              dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components,
              so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of
              $\beta$-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up $\beta$-diversity
              of community composition to the $\beta$-diversity of interactions
              requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will
              help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework
              with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and
              highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda
              towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.",

               a community of mixed species; and they are rarely visited by
               just one kind of animal, but receive visits from several
               potential pollinator types, some of which will be shared with
               other plants. Thus plantpollinator interactions have a strong
               community component, and both plants and animals are subject to
               potential competitive interactions. This was recognized very
               early on in pollination biology (e.g., Robertson 1895; and see
               review by Mitchell et al. 2009). However, many early studies
               largely side-stepped the issue, merely looking at a single plant

  abstract  = "Social transmission of acquired foraging techniques is rarely
               considered outside of a vertebrate context. Here, however, we
               show that nectar robbing by bumble-bees (Bombus terrestris)-an
               invertebrate behaviour of considerable ecological
               significance-has the potential to spread through a population at
               the accelerated rates typical of social transmission. Nectar
               robbing occurs when individuals either bite through the base of
               a flower to 'steal' nectar (primary robbing) or use robbing
               holes that others have made (secondary robbing). We found that
               experience of foraging from robbed flowers significantly
               promoted the development of primary robbing in previously
               legitimate foragers, thus implying that the acquisition of
               nectar robbing by one individual will facilitate its adoption in
               others. Our findings suggest that the positive feedback effects
               of social transmission may potentially play an ecologically
               important role in the relationship between plants and

               analyse patterns of bumblebee (Bombus) decline. We assembled a
               database representing approximately 43\% of the circa 260
               globally known species, which included species extinction risk
               assessments following the International Union fo Conservation of

               species traits presumably associated with bumblebee decline. We

               influence of proboscis length on species-packing, and species
               associations within the local assemblages were studied in local
               communities of bumblebees in northern Spain along an altitudinal
               gradient. Local species abundance and altitudinal range occupied
               accounted for much of the variation in species distribution.
               Altitudinal range occupied by species was related to species
               distribution, but the most important variable accounting for
               species distribution was the local percentage abundance. Despite
               this, there was no evidence for age abundance. Despite this,
               there was no evidence for bimodality in the distributions of
               species incidence. A general trends for mean proboscis length in
               each locality to be greater in lowland localities exists, but
               this variable was not related to species distribution or
               abundance. Proboscis length spacings were studied among species
               in local assemblages and in most of the cases observed spacing
               did not differ from random expectations. The same patterns were
               demonstrated calculating spacings for 'core' species in each

  abstract  = "Studies of innate colour preference and learning ability have
               focused on differences at the species level, rather than
               variation among populations of a single species. Initial
               strength and persistence of colour preferences are likely to
               affect colour choices of na{\"\i}ve flower visitors. We
               therefore study the influence of both the strength and
               persistence of innate colour preference (for blue) on an operant
               learning task (associating food reward with yellow flowers) in
               two populations of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We found
               that both strength and persistence of blue preference differed
               significantly between populations: B. terrestris dalmatinus had
               a weaker and less persistent blue preference than B. terrestris
               audax. These differences in preference also influenced learning
               performance. Considering only landing behaviours, one-trial
               learning occurred in the majority (73\%) of bees, and was
               achieved sooner in B. terrestris dalmatinus because of its
               weaker blue preference. However, compared to landing behaviours
               the relative frequency of approach flights to rewarding and
               unrewarding flower types changed more slowly with task
               experience in both populations. When considering both approaches
               and landings, the rate of learning, following the first rewarded
               learning trial, was faster in B. terrestris audax than B.
               terrestris dalmatinus. However, the net effects of population
               differences in blue preference and learning dynamics result in
               similar final levels of task performance. Our results provide
               new evidence of behavioural differences among isolated
               populations within a single species, and raise intriguing
               questions about the ecological significance and adaptive nature
               of colour preference.",

              bumblebees? A response to Goulson et al",
  author   = "Williams, Paul H",
  abstract = "Recent studies of British bumblebees have proposed a seemingly
              simple explanation for the decline in some species: that greater
              dietary specialization among the rarer species has put them at
              greater risk. However, comparisons of dietary specialization
              require: (1) that bees have access to the same dietary options
              among which to make their choices; (2) that the differing
              relative breadths of dietary choices made are not obscured by the
              differing sample sizes among bee species. Using one of the few
              suitable data sets, I find no evidence for a relationship
              between, on the one hand, rarity or declines in British
              bumblebees and, on the other, their dietary breadths, the
              strengths of their dietary preferences, or their proboscis
              lengths (which influence dietary choices). In contrast, there is
              support for a relationship between rarity or declines within
              Britain and the sizes of species' European ranges, particularly
              when these measures are adjusted to represent their ranges near
              sea level. Adjusted range sizes may reflect overall niche breadth
              and perhaps climatic and habitat specialization. This is not to
              say that climate change is the driving factor for declines or
              that changing food-plant availability is unimportant, but that
              climatic and habitat specialization may be a better indicator of
              risk of decline, which deserves further study.",

               generalized additive model (GAM) and the hierarchical model
               (HGLM). The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of
               nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and
               outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between
               different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical
               connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model
               different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability
               in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted
               using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also
               discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these
               models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data. All
