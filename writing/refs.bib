               considered outside of a vertebrate context. Here, however, we

               invertebrate behaviour of considerable ecological
               significance-has the potential to spread through a population at
               the accelerated rates typical of social transmission. Nectar
               robbing occurs when individuals either bite through the base of
               a flower to 'steal' nectar (primary robbing) or use robbing
               holes that others have made (secondary robbing). We found that
               experience of foraging from robbed flowers significantly
               promoted the development of primary robbing in previously
               legitimate foragers, thus implying that the acquisition of
               nectar robbing by one individual will facilitate its adoption in
               others. Our findings suggest that the positive feedback effects
               of social transmission may potentially play an ecologically
               important role in the relationship between plants and

               na{\"\i}ve animals to find food. As inexperienced bees are known
               to have strong innate colour biases we investigated whether
               bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies with stronger biases for
               the most rewarding flower colour (violet) foraged more
               successfully in their local flora. To test the adaptive
               significance of variation in innate colour bias, we compared the
               performance of colour-na{\"\i}ve bees, from nine bumblebee
               colonies raised from local wild-caught queens, in a laboratory
               colour bias paradigm using violet (bee UV-blue) and blue (bee
               blue) artificial flowers. The foraging performance of the same
               colonies was assessed under field conditions. Colonies with a

               conditions. In fact, the colony with the strongest bias for
               violet (over blue) brought in 41\% more nectar than the colony
               with the least strong bias. As violet flowers in the local area
               produce more nectar than blue flowers (the next most rewarding
               flower colour), these data are consistent with the hypothesis

               associations within the local assemblages were studied in local
               communities of bumblebees in northern Spain along an altitudinal
               gradient. Local species abundance and altitudinal range occupied
               accounted for much of the variation in species distribution.
               Altitudinal range occupied by species was related to species
               distribution, but the most important variable accounting for
               species distribution was the local percentage abundance. Despite
               this, there was no evidence for age abundance. Despite this,
               there was no evidence for bimodality in the distributions of
               species incidence. A general trends for mean proboscis length in
               each locality to be greater in lowland localities exists, but
               this variable was not related to species distribution or
               abundance. Proboscis length spacings were studied among species
               in local assemblages and in most of the cases observed spacing
               did not differ from random expectations. The same patterns were
