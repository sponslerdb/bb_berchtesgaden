  abstract  = "Social transmission of acquired foraging techniques is rarely
               considered outside of a vertebrate context. Here, however, we
               show that nectar robbing by bumble-bees (Bombus terrestris)-an
               invertebrate behaviour of considerable ecological
               significance-has the potential to spread through a population at
               the accelerated rates typical of social transmission. Nectar
               robbing occurs when individuals either bite through the base of
               a flower to 'steal' nectar (primary robbing) or use robbing
               holes that others have made (secondary robbing). We found that
               experience of foraging from robbed flowers significantly
               promoted the development of primary robbing in previously
               legitimate foragers, thus implying that the acquisition of
               nectar robbing by one individual will facilitate its adoption in
               others. Our findings suggest that the positive feedback effects
               of social transmission may potentially play an ecologically
               important role in the relationship between plants and
               pollinators.",

  abstract  = "Innate sensory biases could play an important role in helping
               na{\"\i}ve animals to find food. As inexperienced bees are known
               to have strong innate colour biases we investigated whether
               bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies with stronger biases for
               the most rewarding flower colour (violet) foraged more
               successfully in their local flora. To test the adaptive
               significance of variation in innate colour bias, we compared the
               performance of colour-na{\"\i}ve bees, from nine bumblebee
               colonies raised from local wild-caught queens, in a laboratory
               colour bias paradigm using violet (bee UV-blue) and blue (bee
               blue) artificial flowers. The foraging performance of the same
               colonies was assessed under field conditions. Colonies with a
               stronger innate bias for violet over blue flowers in the
               laboratory harvested more nectar per unit time under field
               conditions. In fact, the colony with the strongest bias for
               violet (over blue) brought in 41\% more nectar than the colony
               with the least strong bias. As violet flowers in the local area
               produce more nectar than blue flowers (the next most rewarding
               flower colour), these data are consistent with the hypothesis
               that local variation in flower traits could drive selection for
               innate colour biases.",
