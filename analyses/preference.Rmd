  summarize(fl.abund = sum(flower.cover)) %>% # get plant.sp*transect total flower cover; this step really shouldn't be required, but in a few cases, there is more than one abundance entry for the same species on a given transect; not sure how that happened, but it's in the original data that Fabrice sent me; alternatively, I could drop the dups or average them. We'll see what Kalli and Fabrice have to say.

### Okay, here's what we're going to do. Preference has a strong bimodal pattern, with lots of plant species totally ignored while the ones that are foraged upon are visited in proportion to their abundance. We can't model that latter pattern well if we retain all the totally ignored plant species. So, let's model the visited plants separately from the unvisited ones. 
```{r}
### Call linear model on the subset of the floral species that were visited at least once
pref.lm <- lm(log(prop.visits.wm) ~ log(prop.fl.abund.m + 0.01), # log on log regression is common for proportional data
              data = filter(visitation_by_abundance_mean, prop.visits.wm > 0))

summary(pref.lm)
plot(pref.lm)

### Extract residuals
pref.lm.resid <- residuals(pref.lm) %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename(preference = 1)
```

Join residuals back into data and summarize by site-date-bb.sp (this deserves its own code chunk)
```{r}

GAM modeling of preference-weighted abundance per bb species
## Against any potential objections to my use of an added constant to avoid the log(0) problem, I would argue that when what is being measured is a resource, the presence of a resource in vanishingly small amounts is biologically equivalent to its absence. I suppose the strength of this argument hinges on how much we trust that our samples represent our sites. But if they don't, what are we even doing here? note that this argument does not hold when one is concerned with diversity and species distributions, since then a species rarity is a very different thing that its absence.
